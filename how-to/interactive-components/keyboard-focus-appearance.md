## Goal

The :term[keyboard focus] must have a sufficient visual indicator.

## What to do

Ensure focusable elements include focus indicators that are visible for people using an input device that relies on the keyboard focus to navigate.

An outline, or indicator which surrounds the focusable element is generally the most easily visible. 

All indicators for keyboard-focusable elements must be:

* **Present**: There is a visible indicator of keyboard focus.
* **Not obscured**: The focus indicator is not obscured or partially obscured (more than 50%, TBC) 
* **Persistent**: The focus indicator persists while the element has focus, but does not persist after the element loses focus.
* **Distinctive**: The keyboard focus indicator uses a style that is distinct from the style of other non-focused controls, so that the item in focus can be distinguished without reference to the non-focused state. 
* **Sufficiently visible**: According to the specific method (below), the indicator must be visually discernible whilst navigating.
